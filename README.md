# Motor Lounge

Motor Lounge is a cross-platform car dealership application with a role-playing system, as well as using a local database to store information. It should be noted that the local database is implemented due to the irrationality of buying a server to host a remote database on it. If you need to convert this template project to a remote database, then this will not be difficult for you.
